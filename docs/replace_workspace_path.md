#Replace Workspace Path

Replaces the workspace path for selected layer files and map document layers.

###Usage Tips
  - The input search results must be layer files or map documents.
  - By default, back ups are created. Backups are created in the source location with a .bak extension. **RECOMMENDED**
  - The workspace will only be updated if the new workspace path is a valid workspace.
  For example, personal geodatabases can be replaced with file geodatabases. However, a geodatabase cannot be replaced by a folder.
