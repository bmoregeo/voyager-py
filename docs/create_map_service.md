#Create Map Service

Create a map service on an ArcGIS Server or a hosted map service on ArcGIS Online.

###Usage Tips
  - The following data types are supported: **Map documents (.mxd), Map packages (.mpk), Layer packages (.lpk), Layer files (.lyr), feature classes, and raster datasets**.
  - When publishing to ARCGIS_SERVER, the ArcGIS Server path is required. This path can be the ArcCatalog path to the server connection or an ArcGIS Server connection file (.ags). 
  - The ArcGIS Server connection must be an administrator or publisher connection.
  - The ArcGIS Online Portal URL is ignored when the server type is ARCGIS_SERVER.
  - When the server type is MY_HOSTED_SERVICES, the ArcGIS Online Portal URL, username, and password are required. The server path is ignored.
  

###Requirements
    - ArcGIS 10.x
