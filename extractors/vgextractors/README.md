Voyager Python Extractors
=========================

Python files in this directory that are properly named will be picked up
by the VoyagerWorkerPy and used as extractors.

Files must follow naming convention: *Extractor.py, and the name of the
file (everything before the .py) must also be the name of a class inside
the file.

See the Md5Extractor.py as an example.
